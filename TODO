QtGreet v2.0.0

1. Custom User Icons
    We will use ~/.face or ~/.face.icon file to get the user icon failing which we will use the default image.
    To make the image have rounded corners use: https://www.qtcentre.org/threads/64382-Display-image-in-Qt-with-rounder-corners

2. QtGreet Widegt Factory
    Generate a widget given the name, apply the selected theme and style settings

3. Layout Manager uing JSON
    A simple JSON file with a predefined set of keys will define the layout

4. Decouple GUI from Backends
    Currently, the greetd code in integrated with the GUI class. We have to decouple it and use a generic QtGreetBackend class to perform the
    various authenticaion/session lauching work.

5. Develop Backends
    We have to develop two backends, one for QtGreet and the other for LightDM.

6. Build a few default themes

7. Write a complete Theming and Layout Guide
