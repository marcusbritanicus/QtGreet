Version 2.0.0
    - Deprecate the use of layer-shell: not all compositors support it, and we do not require it either.
    - Show all windows as full-screens, and place them on various screens using the wlr-foreign-toplevel protocol.
    - You can customize the appearance of the greeter to your heart's content using themes.
    - Some instructions and config files are provided (see the folder configs) to run QtGreet on wayfire and sway.
    - Introducing greetwl - a single screen compositor to display QtGreet.
    - Inbuilt support for Suspend, Hibernate, Shutdown and Reboot via (e)logind, using DFL::Login1.
